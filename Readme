Brain flash about using the lambda approach and spitting a crs model
with additional components in crsiv... guess I might be able to use
names of variables taken from the data frames rather than x1, x2 etc.

Merged snomadr (code for NOMAD is LGPL) into crs so now no
dependencies whatsoever (no gsl, no mgcv, no nomad) so it is
standalone. At this stage could upload to CRAN if I wished and sooner
rather than later I need to do so.

Zhenghua has added a number of useful features.

One is odd - fit.z... I think include and lambda cover these. Will
meet tomorrow morning to discuss.

Also, need R_CheckUserInterrupt() to be called by snomadr as currently
cannot terminate...

Also, global scope variables need to be modified...

Zhenghua makes the big play. He has written snomadr, a standalone R
implmentation of NOMAD. Then he has written R functions that currently
smoke!

Issue 1) I had been modifying endpoints by appending to knot
vector. This won't work. My previous `trimming' approach was in fact
better so perhaps I ought to revert to that.

Now, bs() in spline extends the endpoints (somehow) but throws a
warning, however, it does this without appending the knot vector. The
upshot is that the dimension is unchanged which is desirable - this is
all via the predict() function.

Issue 2) With quantile knots you can get repeated breakpoints when
data as point mass (rounded etc.). I had been reducing the number of
breakpoints dynamically when this happens, but this can throw things
off.

The bs() function handles this more gracefully.

I can envision hacks such as appending an epsilon to each identical
value and augmenting, but this is indeed a hack.
