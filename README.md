# crs

This is the R package `crs' (Categorical Regression Splines) written and maintained by Jeffrey S. Racine (racinej@mcmaster.ca) with the invaluable assistance of Zhenghua Nie.

```

Or download the [zip ball](https://github.com/JeffreyRacine/R-Package-crs/zipball/master) or [tar ball](https://github.com/JeffreyRacine/R-Package-crs/tarball/master), decompress and run `R CMD INSTALL` on it, or install then use the **devtools** package to install the development version:
